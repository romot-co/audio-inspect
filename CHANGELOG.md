## [0.0.4] - 2025-08-07

### Fixed

#### Critical Bug Fixes ⭐⭐⭐

- **Critical**: Fixed `filterFrequencyRange()` returning only last element when minFrequency exceeds Nyquist frequency
  - Now properly returns empty arrays for invalid frequency ranges instead of slice(-1) behavior
  - Prevents spectrum analysis from returning near-silence results
- **Critical**: Fixed `createAudioInspectNode()` crashes with "AudioWorklet module not found" error
  - Added automatic AudioWorklet module registration using `getDefaultProcessorUrl()`
  - README examples now work without manual module registration
- **Critical**: Fixed AudioContext memory leak in `load()` function hitting Chrome's 6-context limit
  - Implemented singleton AudioContext pattern with proper cleanup
  - Prevents "error allocating audio context resources" on 7th+ load
- **Critical**: Fixed A/K-weighting filter coefficients mutation via reference passing
  - Filter functions now return deep copies to prevent cache corruption
  - External coefficient modification no longer affects subsequent calls
- **Critical**: Fixed RealtimeLUFSProcessor division by zero when sampleRate < 2000Hz
  - Added blockSize validation with descriptive error messages
  - Prevents crashes in IoT/8kHz audio applications

#### Performance Improvements ⭐⭐

- **Major**: Optimized `getTimeVaryingSpectralFeatures()` performance by 20x+
  - Now reuses single FFT provider across all frames instead of creating new provider per frame
  - Reduced import overhead and memory allocation in spectral analysis workflows

#### Memory Management ⭐⭐

- **Enhanced**: Verified all FFT provider disposal code paths use proper try/finally patterns
  - All providers now support safe double-dispose operations
- **Fixed**: Added missing cleanup interval setup in AudioInspectNode mock mode for Node.js environments

#### API Usability Enhancements ⭐

- **Added**: `'stereo'` option to `channels` parameter in `load()` options (alongside existing `1|'mono'|2`)
- **Added**: Explicit `'none'` case handling in all window functions (frequency, energy, spectral)
- **Added**: `'blackman'` window function option to `EnergyOptions.windowFunction`
- **Added**: Validation for `oversample()` factor - now restricted to `[2,4,8]` for guaranteed sinc interpolation quality

### Technical Details

- All fixes maintain 100% backward compatibility with existing APIs
- Enhanced error messages provide clearer debugging information for invalid parameters  
- Improved memory efficiency in real-time processing scenarios
- Comprehensive test coverage with 340 passing tests validating all fixes

## [0.0.3] - 2025-07-24

### Fixed

- **Critical**: Fixed RealtimeLUFSProcessor sample counting bug where `sampleCount` was incorrectly incremented per channel instead of per frame
  - In stereo mode, this caused buffer positions to advance 2x faster than intended
  - This fix ensures correct LUFS gating timing and measurement accuracy per ITU-R BS.1770-5 specification
  - Restructured processing loop to synchronize sample counting across all channels
  - Improved measurement precision while maintaining all existing test compatibility

### Technical Details

- The bug affected the 400ms block overlap calculation required for proper LUFS gating
- Fixed synchronization between channel processing and block boundary detection
- Enhanced buffer management to handle multi-channel audio more consistently
